#### Eq logs to graphite

The goal of this project is to parse everquest combat logs into python objects. Eventually it will be able to emmit them in specific formats, json, graphite carbon format, and whatever else.

There's a lot of TODOs in the code now as this is an initial commit. Everything is in stdlib and should be able to remain this way.
